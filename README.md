captheorem-tech-talk
====================

Short talk on the CAP Theorem I gave during my graduate course at USC for distributed databases.

This talk was meant as an introduction talk, and only allowed 15 minutes, most of the material was spoken, since the slides were only used as visual aids.


This tech talk is hosted at: [http://jweaver.github.io/captheorem-tech-talk/#/](http://jweaver.github.io/captheorem-tech-talk/#/).
